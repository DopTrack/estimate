    "# Assignment 3: Tracking station vs. Tracking network: quality assessment\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use simulated observations to investigate how the different settings and variables that can affect the quality of the estimation. To do so, you will modify a number of settings in the above code:\n",
    "- the total propagation time, and the duration of the tracking arcs\n",
    "- the quality of the simulated Doppler measurements\n",
    "- the number and location of the simulated ground stations\n",
    "- the accuracy of the initial guess for the spacecraft's state **prior to the estimation**\n",
    "- the parameters that are included in the estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code automatically provides you with a number of printed outputs and plots. It prints the following:\n",
    "- true errors = deviations between the estimated parameters and their *true* values (i.e. their values in our model, used both to propagate the spacecraft's dynamics and simulate the Doppler data). \n",
    "- formal errors = statistical estimates of the solution's accuracy, for each estimated parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-coded figures show, in order of appearance: \n",
    "1. The ground station locations\n",
    "2. The simulated Doppler measurements as a function of time.\n",
    "3. The ratio between the true and formal errors, for each estimated parameter.\n",
    "4. The initial and final observation residuals (iterations 0 and 10, respectively), as a function of time, superimposed with the $1\\sigma$ and $3\\sigma$ values describing the simulated Doppler noise.\n",
    "5. The histogram of the final observation residuals, again superimposed with the noise $1\\sigma$ and $3\\sigma$ values.\n",
    "6. The correlation matrix between all estimated parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tudat will also print the list of all estimated parameters, which will allow you to trace back which index corresponds to which parameter, both in the figures and in the printed error vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are of course free to provide other plots and/or results to complete this assignment if you think that they bring additional insights or support your argumentation more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this assignment, you can use the following **nominal** settings, unless specified otherwise. \n",
    " - total propagation time = 1 day\n",
    " - tracking arc duration = 1 day \n",
    " - Doppler noise = 1 m/s \n",
    " - ground station = only DopTrack (Delft)\n",
    " - perturbation of the initial guess for the spacecraft's state = based on the next TLE update (see comment in the code for more detail)\n",
    " - estimated parameters:\n",
    "\t - spacecraft's initial state (per arc)\n",
    "\t - Earth's gravitational parameter\n",
    "\t - spacecraft's drag coefficient\n",
    "You are free to modify these settings to either improve your solution, or generate additional results to support your argumentation. If you do so, please indicate it in your report with a short justification for your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIP:** if an estimation fails during the assignment, you might still retrieve the formal uncertainties and correlations by setting the number of iterations to 1. Be aware that the true errors and observation residuals will **not be converged** in this case, but they will simply be returned after only one iteration. The formal errors and correlations, however, might provide some insights into why the estimation failed.  "
