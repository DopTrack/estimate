After amplification of the received signals, they are fed to the in the AOR5001DX radio. An antenna selector is in between, such that it is possible to switch between antennas easily. \n",
    "The radio is responsible for pre-filtering the received signal, but also to tune to a certain frequency you want to listen to. The radio sends the signal to the USRP-N210 Software Defined Radio (SDR), which converts the analog signal to digital data. With the SDR you are able to control the sampling rate, which is linked to the size of the bandwidth you want to record. The SDR will send the data to the computer, where it can be stored/recorded. \n",

    "All the components that work with the antenna signal are synchronized in time and frequency: the radio, the SDR, and the computer. A GPS disciplined clock makes the synchronization possible. The purpose of this is to have accurate time stamping of the signal and also a stable frequency of the internal oscillators in the radio and SDR.

The first order approximation of this frequency change can be expressed as follows:\n",

Of course, in satellite tracking, we are interested in the line-of-sight velocity, $\\Delta v$, which is called range-rate. \n",

This partly confirms our hypothesis, but much is still unclear and need to be studied."
